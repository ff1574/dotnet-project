# ASP.NET Core & jQuery Web Application

This repository contains a web application built using ASP.NET Core and enhanced with jQuery. It demonstrates modern web development techniques, focusing on creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

## Key Features

- **ASP.NET Core**: Leverages ASP.NET Core for robust back-end functionality.
- **jQuery**: Utilizes jQuery for efficient front-end scripting to handle events, perform animations, and make asynchronous API calls.
- **Responsive Design**: Implements Bootstrap to ensure the application is accessible and usable across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive Components**: Includes interactive elements that enhance user engagement through dynamic content updates without reloading the page.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install the software:

- [.NET Core SDK 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) - The software development kit for building and running ASP.NET Core applications
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - Preferred IDE for ASP.NET Core development, however, you can use **VS Code**

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
    git clone https://github.com/ff1574/dotnet-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
    cd dotnet-project
   ```

3. Restore the ASP.NET Core dependencies:
   ```
    dotnet restore
   ```
4. Build the project:

   ```
   dotnet build
   ```

5. Run the application:

   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser to view the application. (Or whichever port you have it set to as default.)

## Usage

This is a simple web app that lets the user browse through a couple of pages that showcase my ability to use different frameworks to create a functional and responsive web app.
